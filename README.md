## Project Forma

A small store front for Shape products.

Add Shapes to the cart, see how many the cart currently holds, check the individual quantities and cart total price by opening the top-right button.

### Future work

The priority for this assignment was to manage focus: work on main functionality first with code that allows room for change and improvement.

At the moment, it's incomplete. The following is a short list for future work:

- Ability to add/remove items from the cart view
- Feedback/graph for empty cart
- Add missing assets: fonts, icons, images
- Responsiveness, lists & overflow
